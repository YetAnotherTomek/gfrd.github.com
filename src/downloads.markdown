The current implementation of GFRD is called eGFRD (the e is for enhanced).

See the [INSTALL](http://github.com/gfrd/egfrd/tree/develop/INSTALL) file for a list
of prerequisites.

### Download eGFRD
You can download the latest release of eGFRD as a
[zip](http://github.com/gfrd/egfrd/zipball/master) or
[tar](http://github.com/gfrd/egfrd/tarball/master) file.

### Clone eGFRD
To check out the development version of eGFRD, make sure you have
[Git](http://git-scm.com/) installed and do:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone git://github.com/gfrd/egfrd.git
{% endhighlight %}

### Browse eGFRD
You can browse the code using a web interface to the [eGFRD
repository](http://github.com/gfrd/egfrd).

### Install eGFRD
Binary packages of eGFRD for Fedora and Ubuntu will be added shortly.

### E-Cell
eGFRD is currently a mirror of the [E-Cell](http://www.e-cell.org/ecell/)
project. Changes are shared between both repositories, although E-Cell is
usually slightly ahead.
