The current implementation of GFRD is called eGFRD (the e is for enhanced).

## Get up and running in minutes
See the [INSTALL](http://github.com/gfrd/egfrd/tree/develop/INSTALL) file for a list
of prerequisites.

### E-Cell repository (Riken)
eGFRD will be included with the next release of the
[E-Cell](http://www.e-cell.org/ecell/) project.

To check out the development version of E-Cell, make sure you have
[Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) installed and do:

{% highlight bash %}
$ hg clone http://t1.gsc.riken.jp/hg/epdp
{% endhighlight %}

### eGFRD repository (Amolf)
This is currently a mirror of the E-Cell project in Git, using
[Hg-Git](http://hg-git.github.com/). Patches are applied to both, although the
E-Cell repository is slightly more up-to-date.

To check out the development version of eGFRD, make
sure you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) installed and do:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone git://github.com/gfrd/egfrd.git
{% endhighlight %}

### Download eGFRD releases
Instead of using Git or Mercurial, you can also download the latest
release of eGFRD as a [zip](http://github.com/gfrd/egfrd/zipball/master)
or [tar](http://github.com/gfrd/egfrd/tarball/master) file.

### Browse
You can browse the code using the web interfaces to the
[eGFRD](http://github.com/gfrd/egfrd) and
[E-Cell](http://t1.gsc.riken.jp/hg/epdp) repositories.

### eGFRD binary packages
Binary packages of eGFRD for Fedora and Ubuntu will be added shortly.
