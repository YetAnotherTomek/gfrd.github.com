The current implementation of GFRD is called eGFRD (the e is for enhanced).

## Get up and running in minutes

Binary packages for Fedora and Ubuntu will be added shortly.

## Check out the source code

Make sure you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) installed.

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone git://github.com/gfrd/egfrd.git
{% endhighlight %}

Instead of using Git, the latest release of the code can also be [downloaded](http://github.com/gfrd/egfrd/archives/master) from [Github](http://github.com/gfrd/egfrd).
